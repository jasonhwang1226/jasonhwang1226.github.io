  "body": "### Introduction\r\nOne sentence \"sound bite\" that describes your project.\r\n\r\nA summary of what you did and why.\r\n\r\n### High Level Design\r\nrationale and sources of your project idea\r\n\r\nbackground math\r\n\r\nlogical structure\r\n\r\nhardware/software tradeoffs\r\n\r\nRelationship of your design to available IEEE, ISO, ANSI, DIN, and other standards.\r\n\r\nDiscuss existing patents, copyrights, and trademarks which are relevant to your project.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Program/Hardware Design\r\nprogram details. Could someone else build this based on what you have written?\r\n\r\nhardware details. Could someone else build this based on what you have written?\r\n\r\nBe sure to specifically reference any design or code you used from someone else.\r\n\r\nThings you tried which did not work\r\n\r\n### Results\r\nThis is the section which is most often lacking in student projects. Be specific! \r\n\r\nIf you took calibration data, then show it!\r\n\r\nIf you have images or video, include it.\r\n\r\nspeed of execution (hesitation, filcker, interactiveness, concurrency)\r\n\r\nBe quantitative. Show graphs!\r\n\r\naccuracy (numeric, music frequencies, video signal timing, etc)\r\n\r\nBe quantitative. Show graphs!\r\n\r\nhow you enforced safety in the design.\r\n\r\ninterference with other people's designs (e.g. cpu noise, RF interference).\r\n\r\nusability by you and other people (perhaps with special needs).\r\n\r\n### Conclusions\r\nAnalyse your design in terms of how the results met your expectations. What might you do differently next time?\r\n\r\nHow did your design conform to the applicable standards?\r\n\r\nIntellectual property considerations.\r\n\r\nDid you reuse code or someone else's design?\r\n\r\nDid you use code in the public domain?\r\nAre you reverse-engineering a design? How did you deal with patent/trademark issues.\r\n\r\nDid you have to sign non-disclosure to get a sample part?\r\n\r\nAre there patent opportunites for your project?\r\n\r\nAre there publishing opportunities for your project?\r\n\r\nEthical considerations. Refering to the IEEE Code of Ethics, specifically explain how decisions you made or actions you took in this project were consistent with this Code of Ethics. I expect at least 200 words on this topic. A bulleted list will not be acceptable.\r\nLegal considerations. For instance, if you use a transmitter, you must discuss the appropriate FCC legal restrictions.\r\n\r\n### Appendix A\r\nThe group approves this report for inclusion on the course website.\r\n\r\nThe group approves the video for inclusion on the course youtube channel.\r\n\r\n### Appendix\r\nAppendix with commented program listing\r\n\r\nAppendix with schematics (you can download free software from expresspcb.com to draw schematics) \r\n\r\nA block diagram is not a schematic.\r\n\r\nAppendix with cost details with all part numbers, vendors, and their price. This cost will include components as described in the Budget Considerations section.\r\n\r\nAppendix with a list of the specific tasks in the project carried out by each team member.\r\n\r\n### References\r\nData sheets\r\n\r\nVendor sites\r\n\r\nCode/designs borrowed from others\r\n\r\nBackground sites/paper\r\n",
